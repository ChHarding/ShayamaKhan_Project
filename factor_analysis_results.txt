# FACTOR ANALYSIS RESULTS

## Keyword: Gender

=== PARAGRAPH 1 ===
Paragraph:
5. Factors Contributing to Cybersickness  
Many potential factors contribute to simulation sickness in virtual environments, such as age, gender, calibration, experience, and application type. P.J Costello [5] has tabulated many of these factors based on the individual, simulator type, and task performed. These factors have a profound impact on the severity of cybersickness. The factors affecting virtual reality are classified according to user, design, display types, and type of VR content. Table 4 provides an overview of some of the factors that contribute to simulation sickness.
Tone: Neutral. 

The paragraph lists gender as one of several factors that may contribute to cybersickness but does not specifically affirm or deny its impact. It mentions gender alongside other factors like age and experience without taking a stance on the degree or nature of its influence. The paragraph remains descriptive and does not provide evidence or argumentation to support or oppose the idea that gender specifically impacts the level of cybersickness experienced by users.

=== PARAGRAPH 2 ===
Paragraph:
5.1.2. Gender  
Simulation sickness may vary according to gender with the use of HMDs. Schafer et al. [41] studied the role of gender, technology, and their potential contribution towards simulation sickness. Using the data obtained from about 223 individuals (108 male and 115 female), they examined the levels of simulation sickness with regards to gender, sensory conflict, and improvements in VR technology. They concluded that women experienced a higher level of simulation sickness compared to men. Stanney et al. [42] conducted multiple experiments and found that females were equally susceptible to motion sickness, and it was due to the improper fit of the VR headset to inter-pupillary distance (distance between the center of one’s eyes). They also suggest a redesign to the VR headsets with alterable inter-pupillary distance to reduce the cybersickness in women.
Tone: Supportive. 

The paragraph provides evidence that gender has an impact on the level of cybersickness experienced by users of immersive technology. It cites studies by Schafer et al. and Stanney et al., both of which found that women experience higher levels of simulation sickness compared to men. The paragraph also discusses specific factors, such as the improper fit of VR headsets, that contribute to this difference, suggesting that gender does indeed play a role in the level of cybersickness experienced.

The factors affecting virtual reality are classified according to user, design, display types, and type of VR content. Table 4 provides an overview of some of the factors that contribute to simulation sickness.
Tone: Neutral. 

The paragraph lists gender as one of several factors that may contribute to cybersickness but does not specifically affirm or deny its impact. It mentions gender alongside other factors like age and experience without providing any specific evidence or argument about the influence of gender on cybersickness. The tone remains neutral as it does not take a definitive stance on the impact of gender.
------------------------------------------------------------

=== PARAGRAPH 2 ===
Paragraph:
5.1. Users  
5.1.1. Age  
Cybersickness is primarily based on sensory conflict theory and postural instability theory. Literature suggests that younger people are more resistant to simulation sickness [32]. Vestibular perceptual threshold, the weakest stimulus detected, diminishes in humans after the age of 40, making them more susceptible to simulation sickness [39]. Era et al. reported that there were postural balance differences between young and middle-aged test participants. In addition, higher age groups experience diminished postural balance which may lead to sickness [40].
Tone: Neutral. 

The paragraph discusses factors related to age and its impact on cybersickness, focusing on sensory conflict theory, postural instability, and vestibular perceptual thresholds. It does not mention or take a stance on the impact of gender on cybersickness, thus remaining neutral with respect to the statement about gender's influence.

## Keyword: Exposure

=== PARAGRAPH 1 ===
Paragraph:
5.1.3. Exposure  
Stanney et al. [43] concluded that an increase in exposure time was directly proportional to the severity of adverse symptoms. Users vulnerable to motion sickness can experience approximately twice the intensity compared to non-susceptible individuals. Users who experience nausea during carnival rides can also expect unpleasant symptoms. Exposing an individual to virtual environments briefly and stopping the encounter before or while experiencing sickness, then retrying in a day or two, will help the user adapt to the virtual environment. Recurring exposure to virtual environments may lower or eliminate simulation sickness. However, using a virtual environment for longer durations is not recommended [32].
Tone: Neutral. 

The paragraph discusses the impact of exposure time on the severity of cybersickness symptoms and suggests strategies for adaptation to virtual environments. It does not mention or take a stance on the influence of gender on the level of cybersickness experienced by users of immersive technology. Therefore, it neither supports nor opposes the statement regarding gender's impact.

=== PARAGRAPH 2 ===
Paragraph:
5.2.1. Head Mounted Display (HMD)  
Factors such as contrast, illumination, exposure duration, and working distance contribute to straining the visual system when working with head mounted displays. Approximately 60% of users reported symptoms such as visual strain, nausea, and headache, while 20% reported a reduction in binocular visual perception when using a stereoscopic HMD, such as EyePhone LX, in an immersive virtual environment for a ten-minute duration [45]. Similar symptoms were experienced by 61% of users after twenty minutes of exposure to immersive virtual content from a DVisor HMD [46]. Technical advancements in VR display hardware, comparing Oculus VR DK1 to Oculus VR DK2, for example, did not have a significant impact on decreased cybersickness [41]. Some symptoms are more likely to occur in virtual environments. However, sensory conflict contributes significantly to nausea and other symptoms. Body motion, head movement-initiated disorientation, and incorrect optical design resulted in strain-producing ocular symptoms. Recent contributions from Tong et al. [47] determined that HMD use caused a higher level of motion sickness compared to stereoscopic desktop displays. Some users enjoyed a higher level of immersion in an HMD. However, they could not sustain the experience for longer periods.
Tone: Neutral. 

The paragraph discusses various factors contributing to cybersickness when using head-mounted displays (HMDs), such as visual strain, nausea, and headache, and mentions technical advancements and sensory conflicts. However, it does not specifically address or take a stance on the impact of gender on the level of cybersickness experienced by users of immersive technology. The focus is on the general experience of users and technical aspects of HMDs, without mentioning gender as a factor.
